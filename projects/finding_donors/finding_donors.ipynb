    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "    The testing set F-Beta Score and Accuracy are pretty much same for both SVM and Logistic Regression models with 100 percent of training set . F-Score is 0.67 for SVM model and 0.68 for Logistic Regression. Accuracy is 0.83 for SVM Model and 0.84 for Logistic Regression Model. However, there is significnce execution time difference between SVM and Logistic Regression. The SVM Model training time is 120 seconds and Logistic Regression training time is 0.22 seconds for full training set. Logistic Regression prediction time (0.003 seconds) is drastically lower compare to SVM Model prediction time (18 seconds). The Logistic Regression is suitable for 45K datasets which is not a large number <br>\n",

    "    The high level activities of data analysis, Supervised model implementation and model selection for CharityML are as follows: <br>\n",
    "    &emsp;<b>- Data Analysis: </b> It is very important to analyze data before choosing a Machine Learning model. The dataset contains 45K records. Every dataset contains 13 types of features and Income values.  I have separated persons' Income data from the features data. The Model has to predict the person's income, whether income is greater than \\$50K or not. <br>\n",
    "    &emsp; <b>- Data Transformation : </b> The data is not distributed evenly for two features, Capital-Gain and Capital-Loss  I have applied \"Logarithmic transformation\" to the Capital Gain and Capital-Loss features to distribute the data evenly. After that, I have normalized Capital-Gain and Capital-Loss features with minimum value 0 and maximum value 1. The Capital Gain and Capital Loss data values are  transformed evenly between 0 and 1 compare to original values. <br>\n",
    "    &emsp; <b>- Data Conversion: </b> Normally, Numeric values tend to tune models more effectively. The dataset contains 8 features with non-numeric values. I have applied \"One-hot encoding\" technique to convert non-numeric values to numeric values.  <br>\n",
    "       &emsp;<b>- Data Splitting: </b> I have divided datasets into two parts, testing data and training data. I have allocated 80% of dataset to training data and 20% of to testing data. The Test Data is utilized to determine predictions. <br>\n",
    "    &emsp;<b>- Naive Predictor Performance:</b> I have calculated Accuracy and F-score with the prediction that every person is making more than \\$50K. We normally apply same prediction value to each dataset in the Naive Predictor.  The False Negatives and  True Negatives became zero in this project. The Recall value is 1. The Accuracy and F-score are very low values in this prediction. The Accuracy score is 0.2478 and F-score value is 0.2917. We will take these scores as baseline to apply to the Supervised Models.<br>\n",
    "    &emsp;<b>- Model Implementation:</b> I have implemented three Supervised Learning Models (Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression). I have trained the Supervised Models with three different datasets, 1 percent, 10 percent and 100 percent of training datasets. The Accuracy and F-Score values are calculated based on predictions and actuals for each training dataset for all three Supervised Models. The Beta value 0.5 assigned consistently to all datasets and Models. <br>\n",
    "    &emsp;<b>- Model Analysis:</b> The Decision Tree model training scores are much higher due to overfitting. However, the Decision Tree model testing scores are very low. I have eliminated Decision Tree from my selection process due to lower testing scores.  Then, I compared two remaining models. Accuracy and F-score are very close for remaining two models, SVM and Logistic Regression. However, the execution time is much lower for Logistic Regression compare to SVM.  <br>\n",
    "    &emsp;<b>- Best Model Determination:</b> I have selected Logistic Regression as a CharityML because Logistic Regression model provided high accuracy, high F-score and low execution time. <br>\n",

    "    <b>Feature Rank#1 Captial-Gain: </b> Person received higher capital gain income in a year are willing to donate charities more genoursly. Donors can offset capital gain income by donating some amount to chariies. Peoples are more generous donating money when they receive a lot of capital gains. Therefore, I have selected Captial-Gain as my best feature to identify potential donors. <br>\n",
    "    <b>Feature Rank#2 Hours-per-week: </b> Person working full time, 40 hours per week, receive higher income compare to part time employees. Full time employed persons (40 hours per week) have higher disposable income. The full time employed pesons can able to donate higher amount to charities compare to part time employeed persons. I have selected Hours-per-week as second most important feature.   <br>\n",
    "    <b>Feature Rank#3 Education: </b> Persons with higer Education  earn more income compare to lower level of Educated people. For example, persons Graduated College successfully earns more money compare to people stuided upto 12th grade (High School) only. The higher income people generoulsy donate amount to charies compare to lower income . Therefore, Education is next important feature.   <br>\n",
    "    <b>Feature Rank#4 Occupation:</b> The Occupation is another important feature. People who are in Management and Executive cadre tend to earn more income compare to Adimin/clearks. The probability of Executive/Management cadre persons donating amount to charities is much higher compare to Admins/clerks. Therefore, I have selected Occuapation as another impoartant feature. <br>\n",
    "    <b>Feature Rank#5 Capital-Loss: </b> Normally, Persons incur Capital losses when a stock market does not perform well. Psychologically, persons who is having heavy Captial-loss in a given year tend to donate less amount to charities. Therefore, I have selected Capital-Losss as another important feature. <br><br>\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
